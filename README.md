# Mercero Deal Desk - Post Install Configuration

Thanks for installing Mercero Deal Desk (MD2). Before using the app, Salesforce must be configured either manually or by using a post install script packaged and distributed with the app.

## CPQ Integration

MD2 is independent of Salesforce CPQ, but it does come with useful features derived from CPQ. In order to unlock Salesforce CPQ integrated functionality, the following custom setting will have to be set:

Setup -> Platform Tools: Custom Code -> Mercero Deal Desk: CPQ Integration  -> Manage -> New

Check "Use CPQ"
